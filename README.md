# Image-Enhancer
 Increase the resolution of your images, using the latest algorithms, with a simple-to-use function in the OpenCV library.
# Models used
1. ESPCN

This is a small model with fast and good inference. It can do real-time video upscaling (depending on image size).


2. FSRCNN 

This is also small model with fast and accurate inference. Can also do real-time video upscaling.
